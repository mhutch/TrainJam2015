Theme: On Track

Inspired by term found in dictionary - "cloud tracks" - the trails left by particles in a cloud chamber.

Visual aesthetic - trails of bubbles behind particles as they go through the medium.

Using CocosSharp as a dogfooding exercise since I've been working on MonoGame tooling.

Working solo since from past experience having multiple programmers on a jam game is tricky
to coordinate, and my ideas doesn't need much art. WIll go around later and look for artists
and musicians with spare time.

Have bounced ideas off a few people. Decided to take further ideas from the electric fields of
particle detectors and the chain reactions of nuclear reactors.

Aiming for a meditative game where you control magnetic fields to guide particles through
a cloud chamber. They can collide with other particles, resulting in chan reactions

Ideas will likely develop over time. Need to think about game driving mechanics - maybe scoring,
or some kind of timed challenge system.

Fusion?

Sounds - pure tones based on the particles?
