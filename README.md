This is the TrainJam 2015 game [Cloud Tracks](https://github.com/mhutch/TrainJam2015)!

Binaries are available at https://mhutch.itch.io/cloud-tracks

### Description

Control a magnetic field to steer particles around inside a cloud
chamber. The camera follows one 'hero' particle, and the different
kinds of particles have special properties. Some are unstable and
explode on collision. This is an exploratory/ambient game with no
set goals.

Following the TrainJam 2015 theme _On Track_, this was inspired by the
cloud tracks left by charged particles in cloud chambers and the
fields used in particle detectors to determine mass/charge ratios.

The physics isn't much like our universe, however.

### Controls

* **SPACE**: Start, Reset
* **UP**: Increase field
* **DOWN**: Decrease field
* **ESCAPE**: Exit

The indicator at the bottom left of the screen shows the
current field strength.
